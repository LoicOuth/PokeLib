# Welcome to Pok√©Lib

This repository hosts my side project, Pok√©Lib, which was created with the goal of building a Pok√©dex using the PokeAPI. Pok√©Lib provides users with the ability to explore and manage Pok√©mon teams, along with a robust user authentication system. The repository is organized into separate folders for the backend, coded in TypeScript with NestJS, and the web application created in Vue 3, utilizing Vuetify and SCSS.

## Project Folders:

- **üìÅPokeLib-Backend**: This folder contains the TypeScript backend code implemented with NestJS. It serves as the backbone of Pok√©Lib, interacting with the PokeAPI, handling user authentication, and providing necessary endpoints for the frontend application. It's build with clean architecture.

- **üìÅPokeLib-Frontend**: This folder contains the Vue 3 web application that serves as the Pok√©dex frontend. Leveraging Vuetify, the application boasts a modern and visually appealing user interface. SCSS is utilized for further styling enhancements.

## Purpose of this Side Project

Pok√©Lib is my passion project and represents my love for Pok√©mon and interest in full-stack web development. This side project allows me to explore and experiment with modern technologies like NestJS, Vue 3, Vuetify, and SCSS, while integrating an external API like the PokeAPI to create an engaging and user-friendly Pok√©dex experience.

## Getting Started

To run Pok√©Lib, follow the instructions in each folder's README for setting up and deploying the backend and web application. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed and configured to experience the full functionality of Pok√©Lib.

## Contributing

While Pok√©Lib is primarily a personal side project, I'm open to receiving any contributions that could enhance its features or fix any issues. Please refer to the contribution guidelines in the documentation for more information on how to contribute.
If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to open an issue. I hope you enjoy exploring Pok√©Lib and find it informative and entertaining, showcasing how to create engaging web applications with NestJS and Vue 3.
